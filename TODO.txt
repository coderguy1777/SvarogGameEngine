---------------------------------------
When it comes to camera zoom, idea that can be applied is that having the zoom be based on mouse scroll.
    ----------------------
    When the event gets polled from glfw, event triggers either forward or backwards zoom, based on 
    the scroll direction.
    ----------------------
    Backwards = -z 
    Forwards = +z
